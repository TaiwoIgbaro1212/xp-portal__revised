This project was created with

## Github Procedures

These Github procedures are to guide you on the [X-PLUG TEAM 7 TEST PROJECT](https://github.com/TaiwoIgbaro1212/xp-portal__revised) and would encourage a real world team experience as we go.

### `git pull origin main`

> git pull origin main

The `git pull origin main` fetches any current changes that has been merged into the master branch...
It is advisable to always pull from the master branch into your local repository before making any push in order to pick up changes made by other team mates.

See the section about [main branch](https://github.com/TaiwoIgbaro1212/xp-portal__revised) for more information.

### `git checkout -b name-new-branch`

> git checkout -b name-new-branch

The `git checkout -b name-new-branch` creates a new branch locally for you ensuring you are working on a safe code space and any unknown new defects would not affect the already working code base.
After each branch has been deployed it will be reviewed before any merge changes into the main branch

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
